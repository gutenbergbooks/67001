<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the “London Gazette,” from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery, and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign’s
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under His Majesty’s special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General’s Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
“firm as the rocks of their native shore:” and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
our fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar’s favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar’s legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>
The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of <ins class="corr" id="tn-x" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'The military foree'">
the military force;</ins><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were “<em>men-at-arms</em>,” and sixty “<em>shot</em>;”
the “men-at-arms” were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the “shot” were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral’s regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
“grenadier company.” Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
similar to those at present in use, were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral’s
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years’ War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years’ war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years’ war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates, in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
arms.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle-fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to insure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world, have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have the
welfare of their country at heart, the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

no occasion has the undaunted valour of British troops ever been more
manifest. At the termination of a severe and harassing march, rendered
necessary by the superiority which the enemy had acquired, and
which had materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages
were to be encountered. These have all been surmounted by
the conduct of the troops themselves: and the enemy has been taught,
that whatever advantages of position or of numbers he may possess, there
is inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows not

victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means.”</p>

<p>The 71st, 72nd, 73rd, 74th, and 75th regiments,
thus numbered, were formed into independent companies
of Invalids in the year 1769, which increased
the number of Invalid Companies from eight to twenty;
they were appropriated to the following garrisons,
namely four companies at Guernsey, four at Jersey,
three at Hull, two at Chester, two at Tilbury Fort,
two at Sheerness, one at Landguard Fort, one at Pendennis,
and one in the Scilly Islands.</p>

<p>These numerical titles became thus extinct until
October, 1775, when the seventy-first regiment was
raised. In December, 1777, further augmentations
were made to the army, and the regiments which were
directed to be raised, were numbered from the seventy-second
to the eighty-third regiment.</p>

<p>The army was subsequently increased to one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
and five regular regiments of infantry, exclusive of
eleven unnumbered regiments, and thirty-six independent
companies of Invalids.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the general peace in 1783, occasioned
the disbandment of several regiments (commencing
with the seventy-first regiment), and thus
changed the numerical titles of certain regiments
retained on the reduced establishment of the army.</p>

<p>In 1786 the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> was directed to be
numbered the seventy-first regiment; the seventy-eighth
to be numbered the seventy-second; and the
second battalion of the forty-second to be constituted
the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment. These corps had been
directed to be raised in Scotland in 1777 and 1779,
and were denominated Highland regiments.</p>

<p>The details of the services of the present <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
regiment are contained in the following pages;

<p class="p1 noindent">The present <span class="allsmcap">seventy-third</span> regiment was authorised,
on the 30th of July 1779, to be raised as the <em>Second
Battalion of the Forty-second Royal Highlanders</em>, and was
embodied at Perth, on the 21st of March 1780. Its establishment
consisted of one lieut.-colonel (and captain),
one major (and captain), eight captains, twelve lieutenants,
eight ensigns, one chaplain, one adjutant, one
quarter-master, one surgeon, one mate, thirty serjeants,
forty corporals, twenty drummers, two pipers, and seven
hundred private men. Soon after its formation, the
battalion marched to Fort George to be drilled and
disciplined, and in the course of the year was ordered
to proceed to England for embarkation for India, where
events had occurred which occasioned reinforcements
to be sent to that country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1781</div>

<p>Hyder Ali, a soldier of fortune, had risen to the
chief command of the army of the Ruler of Mysore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
and when the Rajah died, leaving his eldest son a minor,
Hyder Ali assumed the guardianship of the youthful
prince, whom he placed under restraint, and seized on
the reins of government. Having a considerable territory
under his control, he maintained a formidable
military establishment, which he endeavoured to bring
into a high state of discipline and efficiency. He soon
evinced decided hostility to the British interests in
India, and formed a league with the French. Hostilities
had also commenced between Great Britain and
Holland, and the British troops were employed in dispossessing
the Dutch of their settlements in Bengal,
and on the coast of Coromandel. Thus three powers
were opposed to the British interests in India, and the
<em>Second Battalion of the Forty-second Royal Highland</em>
regiment was ordered to proceed to that country.</p>

<p>About the end of the previous year the battalion
had arrived at Gravesend from North Britain, and on
the 21st of January 1781, embarked at Portsmouth for
India, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Norman
Macleod.</p>

<p>One division of the regiment landed at Madras on
the 18th of May: but the other divisions, consisting of
seven companies and a half, had a voyage of thirteen
months and thirteen days; they ultimately landed at
Bombay in February 1782.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>These divisions, soon after landing, took the field,
and the battalion was subsequently united under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Macleod, when it shared in
the campaign against Hyder Ali and his son Tippoo
Saib.</p>

<p>The situation of Colonel Thomas Frederick Mackenzie
Humberston (Lieut.-Colonel Commandant of the
seventy-eighth, now seventy-second regiment) who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
been despatched with troops to the Malabar coast,
having become very perilous, the second battalion of
the <em>Forty-second</em> regiment, with other troops, proceeded
to his relief at Mungarry Cottah. In the meantime
Tippoo Saib, with his usual activity, suddenly collected
a body of troops, and proceeded to cut off the force at
that station. Notwithstanding the secrecy of the expedition,
Colonel Humberston received some vague
intelligence of its arrival on the northern banks of the
Coleroon, and suspecting at once the design of the
enemy, destroyed the fortifications at Mungarry Cottah,
and retreated to Ramgaree; where receiving certain
information that Tippoo was approaching with the
utmost rapidity, he withdrew to <em>Paniané</em>, fighting every
step of the march. Upon arriving at the river Paniané,
a deep ford, after a search of two hours, was found,
and the troops passed over, up to the chin in water,
with the loss of only two camp followers. He gained
the Fort of <em>Paniané</em> on the 20th of November, much to
the surprise of Tippoo, who had expected an easy
conquest.</p>

<p>Colonel Macleod, of the second battalion of the <em>Forty-second</em>
regiment, having arrived at <em>Paniané</em> from Madras,
the command of the forces devolved upon him, and the
place was immediately invested by Tippoo Saib and
Monsieur Lally, with an army amounting to eight thousand
infantry, including some hundreds of French and
Europeans; ten thousand cavalry, and above six thousand
polygars. The enemy kept up a considerable but
ineffectual cannonade for some days; the British commander
at length endeavoured to surprise the enemy’s
camp, but after forcing an outpost or two, and taking
a few prisoners, the colonel found it necessary to relinquish
the design.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>This sally was returned by Tippoo in a few days,
who made a vigorous attack with his combined army on
the 28th of November, being led by Monsieur Lally at
the head of his Europeans. Tippoo’s forces were everywhere
repulsed with the greatest gallantry, and the
victors profited by their success as much as their
disparity in numbers would admit. About two hundred
of the dead of the enemy, whom he was not able
to carry off, were buried by the British; and a French
officer, who led one of the columns to the attack, was
taken prisoner. Colonel Macleod and the troops under
his command acquired great praise for their gallantry
at <em>Paniané</em>.</p>

<p>Tippoo acknowledged his defeat by repassing the
river Paniané, and placing it as a barrier against the
British. A state of inaction succeeded on both sides
for several days: but in the night between the 11th
and 12th of December, Tippoo suddenly broke up his
camp, and returned by rapid marches to Palacatcherry,
from whence he proceeded directly back to the Carnatic.</p>

<p>In December 1782, occurred the decease of Hyder
Ali, and he left a kingdom of his own acquisition to his
son Tippoo Saib, who now became one of the most
powerful princes in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783</div>

<p>Brigadier-General Mathews having determined to
besiege the city of <em>Onore</em>, situated midway between
Paniané and Bombay, Colonel Macleod embarked as
many troops as the ships were capable of receiving, but
the place was taken in January 1783, before their
arrival.</p>

<p>The President and Council of Bombay had despatched
orders to Brigadier-General Mathews, that he should
penetrate through the Ghauts, (as the passes in the
mountains on both sides of the Indian Peninsula are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
termed,) into the Bednore or Canara country, and particularly
to gain possession of the capital, which along
with a strong fort on a small mountain that joins the city,
were the great depositories of the treasures collected by
the late Hyder Ali, as well as the grand magazines of
his arms and military stores.</p>

<p>After the capture of <em>Onore</em>, Brigadier-General
Mathews, in pursuance of his orders, proceeded further
down the coast, and took the towm of Cundapore with
little loss. He subsequently forced a passage through
the Ghauts, and the rich Canara kingdom, with its
capital, now lay open to the invaders. The city of
Bednore had recently changed its name to Hyder
Nagur, or the Royal City of Hyder.</p>

<p>The government and command of the city and country
were lodged in the hands of Hyat Saib, who surrendered
the place to the British, after an action had
taken place at the Hussanghurry Ghaut. This occurred
early in February 1783; and on the 9th of March
<em>Mangalore</em> fell into the hands of the British.</p>

<p>Tippoo Saib, who had now succeeded to the title of
Sultan, determined to use every effort for the recovery
of these favorite possessions. Having recovered Bednore,
which surrendered on the 28th of April, the Sultan,
in defiance of the terms of the capitulation, ordered
Brigadier-General Mathews and his officers into close
confinement, from which they never returned, being
afterwards put to a violent death.</p>

<p>Tippoo next proceeded to invest <em>Mangalore</em>, on the
Malabar coast, and it required all the abilities of
Lieut.-Colonel John Campbell, major of the <em>Forty-second</em>,
seconded by the well-tried valour of the second
battalion of that regiment, and other corps, to supply
the defects of the fortifications. The place was invested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
on the 18th of May by the whole of the enemy’s
forces, commanded by Tippoo in person. The garrison
under Lieut.-Colonel Campbell (Colonel Macleod being
employed as a Brigadier-General), made a most gallant
and successful defence, subject to hardships and wants
which have seldom been exceeded in the annals of
sieges.</p>

<p>In consequence of the General Peace which had been
entered into with the European Powers, Tippoo became
deprived of his French allies, and the Sultan entered
into negociations for terminating the war between
Mysore and the British, when an armistice took place.</p>

<p>This event terminated the siege of <em>Mangalore</em> about
the end of September, at a time when all the works
which defended the garrison were nearly shattered to
pieces; all the provisions exhausted, and numbers of
the brave soldiers were dying daily, victims of want
and disease.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The contest was, however, again renewed, and the
garrison was a second time invested by Tippoo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1784</div>

<p>The fortress of <em>Mangalore</em> was defended until the
25th of February 1784, when sickness, and the want of
provisions, compelled Lieut.-Colonel Campbell to
evacuate the place, after obtaining the most honorable
terms from the enemy. Peace was afterwards
concluded with the Sultan of Mysore on the 11th of
March following.</p>

<p>The battalion embarked in this year for Calcutta,
and was employed on active service in the Upper Provinces
of Bengal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1786</div>

<p>The <em>Seventy-third</em> Highland Regiment, having in the
year 1786 been directed to be numbered the <em>Seventy-first</em>
Regiment, the <em>Second Battalion</em> of the <em>Forty-second</em>
Royal Highland Regiment was constituted a distinct
corps, and numbered the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> Highland
Regiment, the colonelcy being conferred upon Major-General
Sir George Osborn, Bart., (Lieut.-Colonel of
the Third Foot Guards), from the 18th of April 1786.
The facings were at the same time altered from <em>blue</em> to
<em>dark green</em>.</p>

<p>The establishment of the regiment for the ten companies
serving in India, was fixed as follows:&mdash;One
colonel, with an allowance in lieu of a company; one
lieut.-colonel and captain, one major and captain; eight
captains, twelve lieutenants, eight ensigns, one chaplain,
one adjutant, one quarter-master, one surgeon, one
surgeon’s mate, thirty serjeants, forty corporals, twenty
drummers, two fifers, and seven hundred private men.
The company kept at home for recruiting consisted of
one captain, one lieutenant, one ensign, six serjeants,
eight corporals, four drummers, and seventy private
men: in all nine hundred and nineteen.</p>

<p>On the 11th of August 1786, Major-General William
Medows was appointed to be colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>,
in succession to Major-General Sir George
Osborn, Bart., who was removed to the fortieth regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1789</div>

<p>The insatiable ambition of Tippoo Sultan, the powerful
ruler of the Mysore, soon involved the British
Government in India in another war; he appeared
near the confines of Travancore, at the head of a powerful
army, made unreasonable demands on the Rajah,
a British ally, and commenced hostilities towards the
end of December 1789.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1790</div>

<p>This caused the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment to be removed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
from the Presidency of Bengal, and it joined the
troops under Major-General Robert Abercromby, which
consisted of His Majesty’s seventy-fifth and seventy-seventh
regiments, in addition to other corps belonging
to the East India Company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1791</div>

<p>The Mahratta armies having advanced to Seringapatam
in May 1791, later than the appointed period, their
delay, and other unforeseen circumstances, compelled
General Charles Earl Cornwallis, K.G., to destroy his
battering train, after having defeated Tippoo on the
15th of May, in a pitched battle, and obliged his lordship
to lead back his army, leaving the siege of the
enemy’s capital to be the object of another campaign.</p>

<p>The Bombay army, of which the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
formed part, commanded by Major-General Abercromby,
had, with infinite labour, formed roads, and brought a
battering train, with a large supply of provisions and
stores, over fifty miles of woody mountains called Ghauts,
that immense barrier separating the Mysore country
from the Malabar coast. This army, after surmounting
all its difficulties, had therefore to retrace its steps,
worn down by sickness and fatigue, and exposed to the
incessant rains which then deluged the western coast of
India.</p>

<p>The troops under Major-General Abercromby were
again ordered to act from the same quarter as in the
former campaign; they marched on the 5th of December
towards the Poodicherrim Ghaut, and took possession
of the pass on the 15th of that month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1792</div>

<p>On the 5th of February 1792, General the Earl
Cornwallis directed Major-General Abercromby to
march from his encampment near Periapatam, and on
the 11th of that month he crossed the Cavery, at
Eratore, a ford about thirty miles <ins class="corr" id="tn-12" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'above eSringapatam'">
above Seringapatam</ins>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
and joined the army under Earl Cornwallis on the 16th
of February.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the army under General the Earl Cornwallis
had attacked the forces of the Sultan on the
night of the 6th of February, near <em>Seringapatam</em>, and
gained a decisive victory.</p>

<p>The power of the Sultan being greatly reduced, and
preparations for the siege of his capital having been
commenced, he sued for peace, and a treaty was concluded,
by which half of his dominions were ceded to
the allies. A large sum of money was also to be paid
by the Sultan, all the prisoners in his power were released,
and two of his sons were delivered as hostages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>The French Revolution, which had commenced a few
years previously, had at this period assumed a character
which called forth the efforts of other countries to
arrest the progress of its destructive principles, and on
the 1st of February 1793, shortly after the decapitation
of Louis XVI., war was declared by the National Convention
of France against Great Britain and Holland.</p>

<p>News of this event arrived in India in May 1793; in
June the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment was ordered to prepare
to take the field; it marched soon afterwards
against the French settlement of <em>Pondicherry</em>, on the
coast of Coromandel, and arrived before the fortress in
July,&mdash;being formed in brigade, with the seventy-second
and seventy-fourth regiments, and the third East India
Company’s European regiment, under Lieut.-Colonel
David Baird of the seventy-first regiment; the troops
employed on this service were commanded by Colonel
John Brathwaite.</p>

<p>The siege of <em>Pondicherry</em> was commenced in the early
part of August, the army encamping in a thick wood
where tigers were so numerous, that the natives durst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
not travel in the night. On the 22nd of August a
white flag was displayed by the garrison, with a request
for permission to surrender. The French soldiers in
the fortress had embraced democratical principles, and
were particularly insubordinate; they insisted that the
governor should surrender, but after the white flag was
displayed, they fired two shells, which killed several
men. During the night they were guilty of every species
of outrage, breaking into houses and becoming intoxicated.
On the following morning, a number of them
environed the house of the Governor, General Charmont,
and threatened to hang him before the door, when
application was made to the British for protection. The
English soldiers rushed into the town, overpowered the
insurgents, rescued the governor, and preserved the
inhabitants from further violence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>In the early part of the year 1795, Holland became
united to France, and was styled the Batavian republic.
When information of this event arrived in India, an
expedition was immediately fitted out against the large
and mountainous island of <em>Ceylon</em>, where the Dutch had
several settlements, and the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> Highlanders
were selected to take part in the enterprise; the troops
employed on this service were commanded by Colonel
James Stuart, of the seventy-second, who was promoted
to the rank of Major-General at this period. The fleet
arrived on the coast of Ceylon on the 1st of August,
and two days afterwards they landed four miles north
of the Fort of <em>Trincomalee</em>; the siege of the place was
commenced as soon as the artillery and stores could be
landed, and removed sufficiently near to the place. On
the 26th of August a practicable breach was effected,
and the garrison surrendered. The fort of <em>Batticaloe</em>
surrendered on the 18th of September, and the fort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
and island of <em>Manaar</em> capitulated on the 5th of October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>The regiment continued to be actively employed
until the whole of the Dutch settlements in Ceylon were
reduced, which was accomplished in February, 1796,
when the governor, John Geraud Van Angelbeck,
surrendered the fortress of <em>Colombo</em> to the British arms.
The people in the interior of the island had not been
deprived of their independence by the Dutch, and
they were not interfered with by the British so long as
they preserved a peaceful demeanour.</p>

<p>Major-General Gerard Lake was removed from the
colonelcy of the fifty-third to that of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
regiment on the 2nd of November, 1796, in succession
to Lieut.-General Sir William Medows, K.B., who was
appointed colonel of the seventh dragoon guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797</div>

<p>In April 1797, the regiment proceeded from Colombo
to Point Pedro, in Ceylon, and shortly afterwards embarked
for Madras. It was removed from Fort St.
George to Wallajahbad in October, but returned to
Fort St. George in January, 1798.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>The regiment proceeded from Fort St. George to
Poonamallee in September, 1798, and continued at
that station during the remainder of the year.</p>

<p>The reduction of the power and resources of Tippoo
Saib, effected by the treaty of Seringapatam in 1792,
had weakened, but not extinguished, the evils consequent
on his inveterate hatred of the British. The
Sultan had entered into a negociation with the Governor
of the Isle of France in 1798, and sent an embassy to
Zemaun Shah, sovereign of Cabool, for the purpose of
exciting him to an attack on the British possessions.
Having also derived encouragement from the successes
of Napoleon Bonaparte in Egypt, from which country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the French Directory intended to act against the British
dominions in India, Tippoo commenced augmenting
his military force, and his hostile designs became every
day more apparent. The Governor-General the Earl
of Mornington (afterwards the Marquis Wellesley), seeing
a rupture inevitable, resolved to anticipate the
attack, and ordered the British army to take the
field, and march into the heart of the dominions of the
Sultan Tippoo Saib.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799</div>

<p>In conformity to these orders, Major-General George
(afterwards Lord) Harris, who was serving with the
local rank of lieut.-general, advanced with the army
under his command, on the 11th of February, 1799, and
entered the Mysore territory on the 5th of March. The
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> formed part of the second brigade under
Colonel John Coape Sherbroke, Lieut.-Colonel of the
thirty-third regiment.</p>

<p>The army reached Mallavelly on the 27th of March,
when on approaching the ground of encampment, the
forces of Tippoo Sultan were discovered drawn up on
a height at a few miles distance. The advanced piquets
were attacked by the enemy, and a general action ensued.
The enemy lost one thousand killed and wounded,
and immediately retreated upon Seringapatam.</p>

<p>On the following day the army advanced, and arrived
before Seringapatam on the 5th of April, when preparations
for the siege were commenced.</p>

<p>On the 20th of April an attack was made on an entrenchment
of the enemy, about six o’clock in the
evening. Colonel Sherbroke, commanding the advanced
posts, directed the attack. Three different
columns were to advance at the same time from Macdonald’s
post; one to the left, under Lieut.-Colonel
Michael Monypenny, of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
of four companies of that regiment, and four of the
Bengal volunteers, was to proceed along the bank of
the river Cavery, and to turn the right flank of the
enemy’s entrenched post. Another, to the right, consisting
of the flank companies of the twelfth regiment,
and two companies of Bengal volunteers, under Lieut.-Colonel
Gardiner, was to move along Macdonald’s nullah,
and to turn the enemy’s left. The centre column,
composed of six companies of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>,
and four of the Bengal volunteers, under Brevet
Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable George St. John,
(Major of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment), was directed
to make a feint, which was to be converted into a real
attack, should it be deemed expedient.</p>

<p>The three columns at dusk, advanced under a well-directed
fire from the guns which commanded the
entrenchment. The enemy’s resistance was unavailing,
and the several attacks were completely successful. It
was afterwards ascertained, that the enemy had two
hundred and fifty men in killed and wounded, and it is
remarkable, that although about eighteen hundred of
Tippoo’s infantry occupied the entrenchment, the British,
in this attack, had only one man wounded.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The siege of Seringapatam was prosecuted with
vigour. On the 26th of April, the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> had
Lieutenant James Todd wounded; and Lieutenant
Archibald John Maclean was wounded on the following
day. A breach being reported practicable on the
3rd of May, the assault was ordered, and the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
regiment was selected to take part in this enterprise,
which was ordered to be commenced in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
heat of the following day, as the enemy’s troops would
then be the least prepared to oppose the attack.</p>

<p>The assault took place about half-past one o’clock in
the afternoon of the 4th of May, and the troops for this
service, commanded by Major-General David Baird,
were divided into two columns of attack. The <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>,
with the seventy-fourth regiment, four European
flank companies, fourteen Sepoy flank companies, with
fifty artillerymen, formed the right column, under
Colonel Sherbroke. Each column was preceded by one
serjeant and twelve men, volunteers, supported by an
advanced party of one subaltern and twenty-five men.
A brigade of engineers, under Captain Caldwell, accompanied
the storming party; Lieutenant James
Farquhar, of the seventy-fourth, commanded the European
pioneers, and Lieutenant John Lalor, of the
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, both of whom had examined the ford,
conducted the columns.</p>

<p>The attack was completely successful, and in a short
space of time the British colours waved over the
fortress. The body of Tippoo Sultan was found among
heaps of slain, and was afterwards interred in the magnificent
mausoleum which he had erected over the
tomb of his father, the once powerful Hyder Ali; a
portion of the victorious troops attended the ceremony.</p>

<p>In this manner terminated the siege of <em>Seringapatam</em>,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and the fall of this capital placed the kingdom of Mysore
at the disposal of the British government, and extinguished
a power in India which had proved itself a formidable
enemy.</p>

<p>In the assault on the 4th of May, the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></span>
had Lieutenant John Lalor killed; Captain
William McLeod, Lieutenant John Thomas, and Ensigns
Henry Antill and John Guthrie, wounded.</p>

<p>During the siege the regiment sustained a loss of
twenty-one killed, and ninety-nine wounded, including
all ranks.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> afterwards received the Royal
authority to bear on the regimental colour and appointments,
the word “<span class="smcap">Seringapatam</span>,” in commemoration
of the distinguished gallantry displayed by the
regiment in the storming and capture of that fortress.</p>

<p>In the General Orders issued on the 5th of May by
Lieut.-General Harris, the gallantry of Lieut.-Colonel
Michael Monypenny, and Brevet Lieut.-Colonel the
Honorable George St. John, of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
regiment, is particularly recorded.</p>

<p>In the General Orders issued by the Earl of Mornington
(afterwards the Marquis Wellesley), dated
Fort St. George, 15th May, 1799, it was stated:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Right Honorable the Governor-General in
Council having this day received from the Commander-in-Chief
of the allied army in the field, the
official detail of the glorious and decisive victory obtained
at Seringapatam, on the 4th of May, offers his
cordial thanks and sincere congratulations to the
Commander-in-Chief, and to all the officers and men
composing the gallant army which achieved the
capture of the capital of Mysore on that memorable
day.</p>

<p>“His Lordship views with admiration, the consummate
judgment with which the assault was planned,
the unequalled rapidity, animation, and skill with
which it was executed, and the humanity which distinguished
its success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>“Under the favour of Providence and the justice of
our cause, the established character of the army had
inspired an early confidence, that the war, in which
we were engaged, would be brought to a speedy,
prosperous, and honorable issue: but the events of
the 4th of May, while they even surpassed the sanguine
expectations of the Governor-General in Council,
have raised the reputation of the British arms in
India to a degree of splendour and glory, unrivalled
in the military history of this quarter of the globe,
and seldom approached in any part of the world.</p>

<p>“The lustre of the victory can be equalled only by
the substantial advantages which it promises to establish,
in restoring the peace and safety of the
British possessions in India on a durable foundation
of genuine security.”</p>

<p>Upon the division of the territory subject to the
late Sultan Tippoo, Seringapatam, with several extensive
districts, was allotted to the East India Company;
another portion was given to the Nizam; and a
third to the Mahratta power; the remainder continued
to form an independent state under a descendant of the
ancient Rajahs of Mysore. Thus was the hostile combination
against England confounded, the British
territory extended, and its power and revenue increased.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment remained encamped
until November, 1799, when it was selected to garrison
Seringapatam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>Major-General George Harris was appointed, from
lieut.-colonel of the seventy-sixth, to the colonelcy of
the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, on the 14th of February, 1800, in
succession to Lieut.-General Gerard Lake, who was
removed to the eightieth regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>The regiment remained at Seringapatam until May,
1800. The <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Michael Monypenny, afterwards served
with distinction against the Polygars, during which
campaign great exertions were made, and losses sustained,
of which no distinct record has been preserved.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1801</div>

<p>In October, 1801, the regiment was removed from its
encampment to Gooty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Gooty until December
1802, when it proceeded to Bellary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>In July, 1803, the regiment returned to Gooty, and
in September following, it proceeded to Pondicherry,
in the capture of which place it had participated in the
year 1793.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> remained at Pondicherry until
September, 1804, when the regiment proceeded to
Fort St. George, Madras, where it continued to be
stationed during the remainder of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>On the 8th of September, 1805, the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
embarked at Fort St. George, Madras, for England,
after having transferred five hundred and twelve men to
other regiments serving in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>The regiment arrived in England in the beginning
of July, 1806, and disembarked at Greenwich, where it
was quartered until the middle of November, when, after
discharging the men recommended to be invalided, the
remainder proceeded to Scotland, on board of some
Leith packets. Shortly after the disembarkation of
the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> at Leith, the head-quarters of the
regiment proceeded to Stirling Castle, from whence recruiting
parties were sent to all the towns in Scotland,
and some to England and Ireland, as far as officers
were disposable for that service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>In February, 1807, the regiment was ordered from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Stirling Castle to Glasgow, as a better recruiting station;
but not having proved as successful there as was
expected, it was removed in May following to Perth,
which, from being the town where the regiment was
originally embodied, was expected to prove a better
recruiting station.</p>

<p>In 1807 the regiment received new colours and
accoutrements from Lieut.-General George Harris, and
was newly armed and equipped in that year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>On the passing of the Act, in the year 1808, for permitting
a certain number of the militia of the United
Kingdom to volunteer their services to regiments of
the line, the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> received a very considerable
augmentation of force by volunteers, particularly
from the Irish militia. The number received from the
Scotch regiments of militia, allotted for the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>,
was not at all in the same proportion, and the
only English corps allotted to it was the Stafford militia,
from which thirty-three men volunteered, a circumstance
totally unexpected, from the dislike English soldiers
were known to entertain to the Highland uniform.</p>

<p>In December, 1808, the regiment, being then about
four hundred rank and file, received orders to proceed to
England, to embark for New South Wales, and commenced
its march from Perth on the 26th of that month.</p>

<p>On the order for the embarkation of the regiment
for New South Wales, a second battalion was added to
the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment, which was directed to
be placed on the establishment of the army from the
24th of December, 1808. It was ordered to consist, in
the first instance, of four companies. When these companies
were completed to a hundred rank and file each,
the battalion was to be augmented to six companies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
and so on, in succession, until the establishment was
increased to one thousand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>On the 13th of January, 1809, the regiment embarked
at Leith on board of four packets, and the whole
arrived in the course of that, and the beginning of the
following month, at Gravesend, where the men were
transhipped into two transports, and ordered round to
Spithead. In March the regiment was landed at Cowes,
in the Isle of Wight, marched to Newport, whence,
after a few days, it was ordered to Colwell barracks.</p>

<p>A second volunteering from the militia took place in
April, 1809, by which the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> received a
considerable increase of numbers, particularly from the
Stafford, West Middlesex, and Durham regiments.</p>

<p>In April, 1809, officers and non-commissioned officers
were detached to recruit for the second battalion, the
head-quarters of which were fixed at Nottingham.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>It appearing that the Highland dress was an obstacle
to the recruiting of the regiments wearing that costume,
orders were issued, directing the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, and
five other regiments, to discontinue that dress, and to
adopt the uniform of other English regiments.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>While at Colwell barracks, sixty men, who had
volunteered from veteran battalions to serve at New
South Wales, were transferred to the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
regiment, and were ordered to embark with the first
battalion for that colony, which, by the addition of these
men, and of the volunteers from the militia, was now
upwards of eight hundred strong, and its establishment
was fixed at ten companies, consisting of fifty-four
serjeants, twenty-two drummers, and a thousand rank
and file.</p>

<p>The first battalion embarked on the 8th of May,
1809, at Yarmouth, in the Isle of Wight, on board of
His Majesty’s ships “Hindoostan” and “Dromedary,”
and sailed from St. Helen’s on the 25th of that month.
The fleet touched at Madeira, Port Praya, Rio Janeiro,
and at the Cape of Good Hope, and anchored at
Port Jackson, New South Wales, on the 28th of
December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>The battalion landed at Sydney on the 1st of January,
1810, and detachments were sent out in the course of
that, and the two following months, to the Derwent and
Port Dalrymple, in Van Diemen’s Land; to Norfolk
Island, and to Newcastle, whence Sydney, the capital of
the colony, was supplied with coals, lime, and cedar
wood, for buildings and making furniture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment
having been considerably reinforced by volunteers from
the hundred-and-second regiment (late New South<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Wales corps), which it relieved at New South Wales, and
which was ordered home, its establishment was raised,
in the year 1812, to twelve hundred rank and file,
which included a veteran company formed from the veterans
of the hundred-and-second regiment, and attached
to the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, while the battalion continued to
serve at New South Wales, and was, on its leaving
that colony, transferred to the forty-sixth regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813<br />1814</div>

<p>About the end of the year 1813, an order arrived
from England to embark the first battalion of the
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment for the island of Ceylon, and
the first division, consisting of three companies, sailed
from Port Jackson on board the ship “Earl Spencer,”
hired for the passage, on the 24th of January, 1814.
On the 24th of March two more divisions embarked on
board the “General Hewitt” and “Windham,” and
sailed from Port Jackson on the 5th of April; but the
“Windham” being ordered to the Derwent to take on
board the two companies stationed at Van Diemen’s
Land, the “General Hewitt,” having the head-quarters
and flank companies on board, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Maurice Charles O’Connell, after a very
circuitous voyage round New Guinea, New Britain, and
through the Molucca islands, arrived at Colombo, in
Ceylon, on the 17th of August.</p>

<p>Prior to the embarkation of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment
from New South Wales, Major-General Lachlan
Macquarie,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> commanding in New South Wales, stated
in General Orders, dated 17th March, 1814, that&mdash;</p>

<p>“On the occasion of parting with the first battalion
of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment His Excellency Major-General
Macquarie, the Governor and Commander of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the Forces in this territory, cannot fail to express the
warm feelings of interest he takes in the corps, which
he has commanded for six years; and to assure them,
that no additional prosperity or honor, to which
they may be entitled, in the part of the world where
they are now destined to serve, and where they have
already obtained so large a portion of well-earned
fame, can exceed his sanguine wishes and expectations.</p>

<p>“This station has not afforded the usual field for
military glory; but in as far as the industrious exertions
of those non-commissioned officers and privates,
who could be spared from military duty, have been
exerted, this colony is much indebted for many useful
improvements, which but for the soldiers of the
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment, must have remained only in
the contemplation of those anxious for its civilization
for a length of time, and the Major-General cannot
doubt but that the comforts enjoyed by the colonists,
in consequence of the zealous and laborious exertions
of the soldiers of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment, will
long be remembered with grateful recollections.</p>

<p>“Major-General Macquarie feels particular satisfaction
in rendering his best acknowledgments to
Lieut.-Colonel O’Connell for his attention to the
discipline of the corps, and the health and comfort of
the soldiers under his immediate command, and also
for his zealous and assiduous attention to the duties
devolving on him as Lieut.-Governor, during the
Governor’s necessary and occasional absence from
head-quarters.</p>

<p>“To the field-officers, captains, and subalterns, of
the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment, the Major-General
desires to offer his best wishes for their health and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
happiness, and particularly to those with whom he has
had a long acquaintance, and whose worth and honorable
sentiments he is thereby the more fully enabled
to appreciate; and he has no doubt but that the
martial appearance, and strength of the corps, so far
surpassing what is generally to be met with, will call
forth feelings of surprise and gratification, wherever
their services are required.</p>

<p>“Under these impressions, Major-General Macquarie
now takes leave of the regiment, with that regret which
a long acquaintance naturally inspires, but at the
same time with the consolatory assurance that the
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> will show themselves at all times
worthy of the respect and esteem which cannot fail to
be paid to military bravery and unshaken loyalty.”</p>

<p>The “Windham” having made nearly the same
voyage as the “General Hewitt,” after leaving Van
Diemen’s Land, did not arrive at Ceylon until the
6th of November.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime the reigning sovereign of Candy
had evinced so cruel and tyrannical a disposition, that
he became odious to his subjects, who experienced a
total insecurity of life and property under his rule,
individuals being frequently deprived of both at the
caprice of the king. The governor of one of his provinces
was summoned to appear at the capital; but
this chief, expecting that the sacrifice of his life, and
the seizure of his property, were intended, did not obey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the mandate. The king assembled an army, overpowered
the forces of the disobedient chief, and forced
him to fly for protection to the British settlements in
the island.</p>

<p>In addition to this oppressive tyranny over his own
subjects, the King of Candy, elated with his success
against the refractory chief, prepared to invade the
British territory, against the frontier of which he had
long carried on occasional hostilities. He had also
inflicted cruelties on some British subjects, who had
gone into his dominions on trading speculations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>These circumstances occasioned Lieut.-General
Robert Brownrigg, the Governor and Commander-in-Chief
of the Island of Ceylon, to render assistance to
the natives to throw off the yoke, and at the same time
preserve the English provinces from aggression, by
invading the kingdom of Candy. The British troops
advanced into the kingdom of Candy in seven divisions,
in the beginning of February 1815, and detachments
were formed from the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, and attached
to four or five divisions of the invading army.</p>

<p>The soldiers underwent great fatigue in crossing
mountains, passing morasses and rivers, and traversing
regions inhabited only by the wild beasts of the forest;
they succeeded in overcoming all opposition, and
arrived at the capital in the middle of February. The
king had fled with a small number of his Malabar
adherents; but on the 18th of February, he was surrounded,
and made prisoner by his own subjects, who
showed the utmost detestation of the tyrant.</p>

<p>A solemn conference was held between the British
Governor and the Candian chiefs, and the assembly
declared the Malabar dynasty deposed, and the provinces
of Candy united to the dominions of the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Crown. Thus was an extensive tract of country,
bountifully endowed with natural gifts, and producing
the necessaries and luxuries of life, including spices,
metals, and precious stones, added to the British
dominions; a numerous race of human beings, of a
peculiarly interesting character, was delivered from
the power of despotism, and brought under the
advantages of the just government and equitable laws
of Great Britain. Every species of torture was immediately
abolished; but the ancient religion of the
inhabitants, and the former mode of administering
justice, were preserved. The conduct of the British
troops was highly meritorious, and reflected credit on
the several corps employed in this enterprise; the
soldiers abstained from plunder and violence, and
behaved with such order and regularity as to conciliate
the inhabitants, whose condition, improved by a policy
founded on liberal ideas, and exhibiting enlarged
views, prepared the way for their emancipation from
the errors of superstition, and their introduction to the
advantages of Christianity, and of European arts,
sciences, and commerce.</p>

<p>While the first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> was
thus employed, the <em>Second Battalion</em> had acquired the
word “<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>” for the regimental colour and
appointments, in commemoration of its distinguished
services in that memorable battle, which terminated
the lengthened war in which the powers of Europe
had been engaged.</p>

<p>A portion of the British troops occupied posts in
the newly-acquired territory, and the corps not
required for this duty returned to their former
quarters. The first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
regiment was again stationed at Colombo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1816</div>

<p>During the year 1816 the battalion continued to be
stationed at Colombo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>In the month of September 1817, intimation was
received at Colombo, that several Candian chiefs, who
were hostile to British interests, were making preparations
in various parts of the interior provinces of
Ceylon, in favour of a new claimant to the throne of
Candy, who subsequently arrived in the island from
the continent of India, and they actually commenced
hostilities on the 25th of October, 1817, by the murder
of a native Mahandiram in Ouva, and by that of Mr.
Wilson, the collector of that place, who had gone out to
remonstrate with the natives assembled in the vicinity
of Badulah.</p>

<p>Detachments from all the regiments stationed in
Ceylon were in consequence ordered into the interior,
and the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> furnished for this service
nearly the whole of the officers and men fit to march.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>The head-quarters of the battalion were transferred,
in December 1817, from Colombo to Trincomalee, and
a detachment from the second battalion, which
had been disbanded on the 4th of May, of this
year, having arrived from England at the latter port,
it was immediately ordered into the interior, where
the rebellion had become general in the beginning
of 1818.</p>

<p>On this service the battalion lost ten officers, and
three hundred and sixty-six men, of whom only one
officer (Lieutenant John Maclaine) and about twenty
men were killed, or died of wounds inflicted by the
enemy, the remainder having fallen victims to the
unhealthiness of the climate, which even after the
rebellion was subdued, continued to prove fatal to the
officers and men who remained on service in the interior.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
The frequent exposure to the sun, and the heavy
dews at night (when detachments were constantly on
the march, particularly in the mountainous districts,
where the enemy could not be surprised by day)
together with a scarcity of provisions, brought on the
jungle fever to an alarming extent, and had not an
auxiliary force been sent from Madras, the interior of
the island must of necessity have been evacuated.</p>

<p>In this harassing campaign, the superiority of the
British over the native troops acting with them, was
very evident; small parties only could be employed
with effect, and therefore, more individual courage and
exertion were required than with large bodies, where
the excitement is much greater. The want of surgical
aid was severely felt, and the officers at last, with the
assistance of manuscript instructions, administered
medicine, dressed wounds, and, on some occasions, performed
trifling operations. Besides fever and dysentery,
leech-bites were the occasion of many casualties.</p>

<p>The peculiar kind of warfare carried on during this
campaign, afforded many opportunities for the officers
and men to distinguish themselves. The following,
among many instances, is deserving of record. A very
small party of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, in charge of Lance-Corporal
Richard McLoughlin, was furiously attacked
on its march to Badulah, by a numerous force;
two men were killed, and the rest, instead of leaving
their deceased comrades to the Candians, who generally
mutilated the remains of British soldiers, divided;
part remained in charge of the bodies, and the other
portion, at an equal risk, proceeded to Badulah, a few
miles distant, and returned with a reinforcement, that
enabled them to carry off their deceased comrades, in
spite of the exertions of the enemy to the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>For this gallant conduct, medals were struck by the
Ceylon Government for the following men, who, however,
died of fever before they could be issued, namely,
Lance-Corporal Richard McLoughlin, Privates John
Wilson, Christopher Sheppard, and William Connor.</p>

<p>Whether the <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span> medals worn by the men
who formerly belonged to the <em>Second Battalion</em>, caused
an extraordinary emulation amongst the other soldiers
of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> is a question; it is, however,
matter of fact, that their conduct during the whole of
the campaign gave not only their own officers, but
those of other corps, the highest satisfaction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>In 1819, the nineteenth regiment was ordered home
from Ceylon, when one hundred and seventy-two men
volunteered to the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>Upon the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> being directed to proceed
to England in 1821, all the men fit for service in a
tropical climate were permitted to volunteer, in the
first instance, to regiments in Ceylon, and ultimately
to His Majesty’s regiments stationed in the territories
of the East India Company.</p>

<p>A detachment of one subaltern, three serjeants, one
drummer, and forty-six rank and file, embarked as
<em>Marines</em> on board of His Majesty’s ship “Alligator,” on
the 22nd of May, 1821; the remainder of the regiment
embarked at Trincomalee on the 25th of June following,
and landed at Gravesend on the 10th of November.
It was then ordered to proceed to the barracks
at Weedon, to which place the depôt of the regiment
had been a short time before removed from Chichester,
and where most of the men brought home were soon
afterwards invalided.</p>

<p>The establishment of the regiment was, on its
arrival, reduced to eight companies, forming a total of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
four field officers, eight captains, sixteen subalterns,
five staff, twenty-nine serjeants, twelve drummers,
twenty-four corporals, and five hundred and fifty-two
privates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>In March, 1823, the regiment was ordered to proceed
to Hull, and to furnish detachments at Chester,
Carlisle, and Tynemouth: in May it marched to
Edinburgh Castle, furnishing detachments at Glasgow,
Stirling and Dumbarton Castles, and at Fort William.</p>

<p>In December, 1823, the regiment embarked at Port
Patrick for Ireland, and was stationed at Castlebar,
furnishing twelve small detachments within the limits
of the counties of Mayo and Galway.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824<br />1825</div>

<p>The regiment was assembled at Athlone in June,
1824, where it was quartered until July, 1825, when the
head-quarters were removed to Naas, and detachments
were furnished to Drogheda, Wicklow, Trim, and some
villages in the counties of Kildare and Wicklow.</p>

<p>In 1825, the regiment was augmented to ten companies,
consisting, while at home, of forty-two serjeants
(including six staff serjeants), fourteen drummers, and
seven hundred and forty rank and file; when ordered
on foreign service to be divided into six service companies,
of four serjeants, and eighty-six rank and file
each; and four depôt companies for home service,
consisting each of three serjeants, one drummer, and
fifty-six rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826</div>

<p>In November, 1825, the regiment was reunited in
the Royal Barracks at Dublin, where it continued until
May, 1826, when, in consequence of riots in the manufacturing
towns in Lancashire and Yorkshire, it was
ordered to proceed to England. The head-quarters
were fixed at Halifax, and detachments were sent to
Huddersfield, Bradford, and to various other towns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>Tranquillity being restored in the above counties,
the regiment was ordered to return to Dublin in July,
1826, and from thence it proceeded in August to
occupy its former quarters at Naas, and the outposts.</p>

<p>In December following, the regiment received orders
to march to Waterford, furnishing detachments at
Kilkenny, Wexford, Carrick-on-Suir, and Duncannon
Fort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827</div>

<p>In August, 1827, the regiment was ordered to
Fermoy, preparatory to embarkation, where in the
course of the month, the service and depôt companies
were formed.</p>

<p>The service companies embarked at Cove for
Gibraltar towards the end of August and beginning
of the following month, and arrived at their destination
on the 10th, 17th, and 24th of September.</p>

<p>The depôt companies remained in Ireland during
this and the two following years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828</div>

<p>During the prevalence of the contagious and dreadful
fever which visited Gibraltar in the year 1828, the
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> were encamped with the twenty-third
Royal Welsh Fusiliers on Europa Flats, from the 10th
of October to the 17th of January, 1829.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1829</div>

<p>The casualties in the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> were, compared
with the other regiments in that garrison, fortunately
limited to a small number. Out of nine officers and
one hundred and ninety-six privates, who were attacked
with the disease, only two officers and thirty-five men
proved fatal cases. Lieutenant Hedworth Huddleston
Williamson, and Assistant Surgeon John Gordon
Fraser were the officers; the latter, though a very
young assistant, fell a victim to his zeal for the service.</p>

<p>Whether the comparatively few casualties were
attributable to the successful practice of the Surgeon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
George Martin, or some other accidental cause, can
be only matter of conjecture. One thing, however, is
certain, that His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor,
as well as numerous other officers unconnected with
the regiment, acknowledged, in the most public manner,
the talents and attention of Surgeon Martin, of the
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, on this trying occasion.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Frederick Adam, K.C.B., was
appointed colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment on
the 22nd of May, 1829, in succession to General George
Lord Harris, G.C.B., deceased.</p>

<p>In December, 1829, the service companies embarked
for Malta, where the last division arrived on the 31st
of that month.</p>

<p>On the departure of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> from
Gibraltar, His Excellency the Lieut.-Governor, General
Sir George Don, G.C.B., issued the following order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right fs80">
“<em>Head Quarters,<br />
Gibraltar, 2nd December, 1829.</em></p>

<p>“His Excellency the Lieut.-Governor is desirous
to express to the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, on their departure
from this garrison, the satisfaction afforded him by
their regular and orderly conduct during the period
of upwards of two years that they have been under
his command, and he feels peculiar pleasure in
noticing, that in no instance has any individual of
this corps been reported to him for any irregularity
on duty during the above period.</p>

<p>“To the officers, non-commissioned officers, and
privates of this regiment, His Excellency offers his
thanks, and more particularly to Colonel O’Connell,
whose zeal and constant attention must have so essentially
contributed to maintain the discipline and
good order of the corps under his command.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>The first two divisions of the regiment embarked on
board the “Lord Suffield” and “Stentor” transports on
the 2nd of December, and sailed the same day; the last
division (head-quarters) embarked on board the “Henry
Porcher” on the 8th. The first two ships reached Malta
on the 20th of December, and performed the usual
quarantine in the Lazaretto; but the “Henry
Porcher” experienced such severe weather on the 10th
and 11th off Capo de Gato, that she had to put back
again to Gibraltar in distress. She, however, sailed
again on the 15th, and the men landed in the
Lazaretto on the 1st of January, 1830.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1830</div>

<p>In February, 1830, the depôt companies were removed
from Ireland to Great Britain.</p>

<p>The service companies remained in St. Elmo barracks
during the year 1830, and at the periodical inspection
which took place in April, the Commanding Officer
(Colonel O’Connell), by desire of Major-General the
Honorable Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby, Lieut.-Governor
of Malta, issued the following order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right fs80">“<em>Valetta, 5th April, 1830.</em></p>

<p>“The Commanding Officer has great pleasure in complying
with the desire of the Major-General commanding,
that he should express in regimental orders
the General’s perfect satisfaction with everything he
has this day seen of the regiment.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the 22nd of July, 1830, Colonel Maurice Charles
O’Connell was promoted to the rank of Major-General;
and on the 25th of the ensuing month the following
farewell address was read to the regiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Major-General O’Connell, being removed from the
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment by promotion, avails himself
of the kindness of Major Lloyd, now commanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
officer of the regiment, to address to it a few farewell
words.</p>

<p>“The Major-General cannot contemplate his separation
from a corps, endeared to him by all those sacred
ties which bind the members of a family together,
and which have, in their fullest sense, existed between
him and the regiment for a period of nearly twenty-five
years, that he has almost uninterruptedly commanded
it in so many parts of His Majesty’s
dominions, at home and abroad, without experiencing
sensations which he would find it impossible to describe
here, but which he feels most acutely. He will
content himself with requesting the officers of the
regiment, generally, to accept his most sincere thanks
for the kindness that he experienced from them, and
for the uniform, undeviating attention they have paid
to his orders, and to his suggestions for the good of
the regiment; where every officer merited his approbation,
the Major-General cannot particularise individuals,
but he feels himself called on by a sense of
justice, as well as of duty, and he certainly has great
pleasure in obeying that call, to offer to his friend
Lieutenant and Adjutant Russell his most particular
thanks for the zealous and effectual aid he has ever
received from him in the discharge of every duty,
and to declare, that to the exertions and abilities of
this meritorious officer he is mainly indebted for the
high state of discipline which has characterised the
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment, in every garrison where it
has been stationed.</p>

<p>“To the non-commissioned officers and men, he begs
to express his thanks for, and his approbation of, their
uniform good conduct, which he exhorts them to
persevere in, as the surest means of insuring to themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
the approbation of their superiors, exemptions
from punishment, and of preparing them for acquiring
honor and glory, when called to meet the enemies of
their country in the field.</p>

<p>“The Major-General will conclude by assuring both
officers and men, that their happiness and glory will
be for ever dear to him, and that to the latest day
of his life he will consider the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment
as part of his family, whose interests are inseparably
interwoven with his own. Should any
fortunate event ever enable him to promote the
general welfare of the regiment, or the individual
interest of any of its members, whether officers, non-commissioned
officers, or privates, he hopes it is needless
for him to declare with what pleasure he shall
avail himself of the opportunity.</p>

<p>“He now, with sincerest good wishes for the health,
happiness, and glory of the whole, bids them adieu.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1838</div>

<p>The service companies embarked at Zante for Gibraltar
on the 21st of January, 1838, and arrived at that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
fortress in the following month. In April and May of
that year they proceeded to Nova Scotia, and in July,
1838, were removed to Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1839</div>

<p>During the year 1843 the regiment remained at
Newport.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1844</div>

<p>The regiment embarked by divisions at Newport,
on the 8th and 16th of August, 1844, and disembarked
at Kingstown, Dublin, on the 11th
and 19th of that month. In December, the regiment
moved from Richmond to the Royal Barracks at
Dublin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1845</div>

<p>Major-General Sir Robert Henry Dick, K.C.B., was
appointed colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment on
the 10th of June, 1845, in succession to Lieut.-General
William George Lord Harris, K.C.H., deceased.</p>

<p>The service companies, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Charles Jowett Vander Meulen, embarked at
Cork in H.M. troop-ship “Apollo” on the 29th of
September, 1845, for the Cape of Good Hope. In consequence,
however, of political events in South America,
they were required (together with the reserve battalion
of the forty-fifth regiment) by the British minister at
Rio Janeiro to proceed to the river Plate, and they
were disembarked at Monte Video in January, 1846.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1846</div>

<p>On the 3rd of April, 1846, Major-General Sir John

regiment, in succession to Major-General Sir
Robert Henry Dick, K.C.B. and K.C.H., who was
killed on the 10th of February, 1846, at the battle of
Sobraon.</p>

<p>While the service companies were stationed at
Monte Video, from January to July, 1846, they were
employed in the protection of the town, and of the
British merchants and inhabitants, against an Argentine
force under General Oribe, who was investing
the place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1847</div>

<p>In July, the service companies were re-embarked
for the Cape of Good Hope, and arrived at Cape Town
in August. After landing their sick, they were ordered
to proceed to Waterloo Bay, near to the Great Fish
River, there to disembark, and join the troops employed
in the field against the Kaffirs, on which arduous duty
the regiment was subsequently employed.</p>

<p>From the 1st of January to the 3rd of February,
1847, and from the 10th of September to the end of

remained in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1850</div>

<p>In December, 1850, the head-quarters and four
companies, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
William Eyre, were removed from Cape Town to the

<p>As the population of the Highlands of Scotland is found to be
insufficient to supply recruits for the whole of the Highland corps
on the establishment of His Majesty’s army, and as some of these
corps laying aside their distinguishing dress, which is objectionable to
the natives of South Britain, would, in a great measure, tend to facilitate
the completing of their establishment, as it would be an inducement
to the men of the English militia to extend their services in

<p class="p1 noindent">Europe enjoyed but a short interval of tranquillity by
the treaty of Amiens, which was signed on the 27th of
March, 1802. In May of the following year, the war
was renewed, and Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul
of the French Republic, threatened the invasion of
Great Britain. On the 18th of May, 1804, Napoleon
was invested with the dignity of Emperor of the French,
and on the 26th of May of the succeeding year, he was
crowned at Milan as King of Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>In December, 1804, Spain issued a declaration of
war against England, and agreed to furnish a powerful
aid to the French Emperor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>While the French pursued a victorious career in
Germany, they experienced dreadful reverses from the
British navy, particularly on the 21st of October, 1805,
when the combined fleets of France and Spain were
completely defeated off <em>Cape Trafalgar</em>. The victory
was, however, clouded by the death of Admiral Viscount
Nelson, to whose memory a grateful and admiring
nation paid the highest honors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1806<br />1808</div>

<p>In the year 1806, the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment
arrived in England from the East Indies, and two years
afterwards was ordered to embark for New South Wales.
On the promulgation of the orders for this embarkation,
it was directed that a <em>second battalion</em> should be added
to the regiment, which was to be placed on the establishment
of the army from the 24th of December, 1808.</p>

<p>The second battalion was, in the first instance, to
consist of four companies, at a hundred rank and file
each; upon the effectives exceeding four hundred, it
was to be augmented to six hundred, which number
being completed, it was to be augmented to a thousand
rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>The battalion was embodied at Nottingham, and was
considerably strengthened, within the year 1809, by
volunteers from the English, Irish, and Scotch Militia.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1810</div>

<p>In March, 1810, the battalion proceeded to Ashborne,
and subsequently to Derby and Ashford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>On the 25th of October, 1811, the establishment of
the battalion was augmented to six companies, consisting
of thirty-four serjeants, twelve drummers, and
six hundred rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1812</div>

<p>In July, 1812, the battalion was removed from Ashford
to Deal, and afterwards proceeded to the Tower
of London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>While quartered in the Tower of London, in 1813,
the battalion was augmented to ten companies, consisting
of forty-five serjeants, twenty-two drummers,
and eight hundred rank and file. The battalion proceeded
to Colchester in April.</p>

<p>The dreadful disasters experienced by the French in
their retreat from Russia, combined with the successes
obtained over the forces of Napoleon in the Peninsula
by the allies under the Marquis of Wellington, caused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
the separation of Prussia and other states from the
interest of France, and a treaty of alliance and subsidy
was concluded between Great Britain and Sweden, in
which it was stipulated that a Swedish army, commanded
by the Crown Prince,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> should join the Allies.</p>

<p>On the 25th of May, 1813, the battalion, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel William George (afterwards
Lord) Harris, embarked on a particular service at
Harwich, but subsequently joined the expedition to
Stralsund, in Swedish Pomerania, under the command
of Major-General Samuel Gibbs, and landed at that
town on the 7th of August.</p>

<p>From Stralsund the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> proceeded to
join the allied forces under the command of Lieut.-General
Count Wallmoden, who engaged, and completely
defeated, the enemy on the plains of <em>Gorde</em>,
on the 16th of September, 1813. The <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
was the only <em>British</em> battalion in the action.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The battalion was afterwards ordered to join the
British forces, then in the north of Germany, under the
command of Major-General Samuel Gibbs, at Rostock,
and subsequently embarked for England at Warnemunde
on the 2nd of November, but on arriving at
Yarmouth the battalion was ordered, without landing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
to join the army in Holland under General Sir Thomas
Graham, afterwards Lord Lynedoch: the battalion
arrived at Williamstadt on the 18th of December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>The Prussian General, Bulow, having requested that
the British would make a forward movement upon
<em>Antwerp</em>, to favour his operations, the battalion
accordingly marched to the attack of that place, which
was bombarded by the British forces on the 13th of
January, 1814; and again from the 2nd until the 6th
of February, for the purpose of destroying the French
fleet lying there.</p>

<p>In the attack on the village of <em>Merxem</em> on the 2nd of
February, 1814, where the enemy was strongly posted,
Lieutenant John McConnell, and Lieutenant and
Adjutant Thomas Frederick James were wounded, the
former severely. A volunteer, named J. Simpson, was
also dangerously wounded. This youth was about
sixteen years of age, and was attached to the light
company. Soon after the action commenced, and in the
course of a few minutes, he was shot through both his
legs, before which a bullet had lodged in the butt of
his firelock. His military career was short, as he died
of his wounds in a few days.</p>

<p>On this occasion, the light company, under Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
Richard Drewe, supported the ninety-fifth (rifle
brigade) in driving the enemy from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abatis</i> formed
at the entrance to the village. The troops suffered
very severely during the foregoing operations from the
intense cold, the winter being unusually severe, and
though sleeping on the line of march was generally
fatal, it was no easy matter to prevent it.</p>

<p>General Sir Thomas Graham stated in his despatch,
“All the troops engaged behaved with the usual spirit
and intrepidity of British soldiers,” and the conduct
of Major Dawson Kelly, of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, was
particularly noticed.</p>

<p>After this success the British troops were employed
in constructing a breastwork and battery; on the 3rd
of February several pieces of heavy ordnance opened
upon the city of Antwerp, and on the French shipping
in the Scheldt; the cannonade was continued until the
6th, when General Bulow, having received orders to
march southward, to act with the grand army of the
Allies, it became necessary to relinquish the attack on
Antwerp, when the British retired towards Breda.</p>

<p>On the 16th of March, 1814, a detachment of the
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, consisting of two hundred men, under
the command of Major Dawson Kelly, was bombarded
by a French seventy-four gun-ship and eight gun
brigs, in Fort Frederick on the river Scheldt.</p>

<p>Peace was shortly afterwards concluded. On the 4th
of April, Napoleon Bonaparte signed his abdication in
favour of his son; but this proposal being rejected, he
signed in a few days a second abdication, renouncing
the thrones of France and Italy entirely for himself and
heirs. He afterwards selected Elba for his residence,
which island was ceded to him in full sovereignty for
life, and a pension payable from the revenues of France,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
and by the treaty which was signed at Paris on the 11th
of April between the Allies and Napoleon, it was agreed
that he should enjoy the imperial title for life. Ample
pensions were also assigned to his relatives.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of May, 1814, Louis XVIII. entered
Paris, and ascended the throne of his ancestors, and on
the 30th of that month the general peace between
France and the allied powers of Austria, Russia, Great
Britain, and Prussia, was signed at Paris.</p>

<p>In the beginning of May, the battalion was ordered
into quarters at Antwerp, and in September following
it marched to Tournay, where it arrived in October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>The commencement of the year 1815 saw Louis
XVIII. apparently firmly seated on the throne of
France; but various causes of discontent existed in that
country. The army, long accustomed to war, still retained
a chivalrous veneration for Napoleon Bonaparte,
who was kept acquainted with the state of the public
mind, and this feeling of his former troops. In the
evening of the 26th of February he embarked at Porto
Ferrajo, in the island of Elba, with about a thousand
troops, of whom a few were French, and the remainder
Poles, Corsicans, Neapolitans, and Elbese. With this
motley band he landed at Cannes, in Provence, on the
1st of March, 1815, and the result proved that his calculations
were correct. After being joined by the garrison
of Grenoble, he proceeded to Lyons, and entered
that city amidst the acclamations of “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive l’Empereur!</i>”
from the soldiers and the people. The possession of the
second city in France being thus obtained, Napoleon
assumed his former dignity of Emperor, and continued
his advance to Paris, which he reached on the 20th of
March, his progress having been a continued triumph.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Louis XVIII. had withdrawn from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Paris to Ghent, and Napoleon took possession of the
throne of France as Emperor, but the allied powers
refused to acknowledge his sovereignty, and determined
to effect his dethronement.</p>

<p>The battalion had remained stationed between Tournay
and Courtray until March, 1815, when, in consequence
of the foregoing events, it was ordered to join
the division of the army under the command of Lieut.-General
Baron Alten, and formed part of the brigade
of Major-General Sir Colin Halkett, K.C.B.</p>

<p>On the 11th of April, 1815, it was announced to the
army in Flanders that His Royal Highness the Prince
Regent, in the name and behalf of His Majesty, had
appointed Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington, K.G.,
to be commander of His Majesty’s forces on the continent
of Europe, and it was directed that the <em>Fifth</em>
British brigade of infantry should be composed of the
second battalion of the thirtieth, the thirty-third,
and the second battalions of the sixty-ninth and
seventy-third regiments.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Napoleon left Paris on the 12th of June, and endeavoured,
by one of those rapid and decisive movements
for which he had been celebrated, to interpose
his forces between the British and Prussian armies, and
then attack them in detail. Information of this movement
arrived at Brussels during the evening of the 15th
of June, and the troops were immediately ordered to
prepare to march.</p>

<p>On the 16th of June, the division of which the second
battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> formed part, pursued
its course, with the other portions of the army, through
the forest of Soignies, Genappe, and along the road towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
Charleroi. After a march of twenty-two miles
the troops arrived at the post of <em>Les Quatre Bras</em>, where
the second French corps, under Marshal Ney, was developing
a serious attack against that position, with
very superior numbers.</p>

<p>As the British regiments arrived at the scene of
conflict, they were instantly formed for action. The
repeated charges of the French were repulsed, but a
considerable loss was incurred, including his Serene
Highness the Duke of Brunswick, who fell at the head
of his troops.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> had the following officers
wounded:&mdash;Lieutenants John Acres and John Lloyd,
and Ensigns Robert Greville Heselrige and Thomas
Deacon. Lieutenant Acres died of his wounds. One
drummer, and three rank and file were killed, and one
serjeant and forty-three rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>Marshal Blucher had been attacked on the 16th of
June by Napoleon at Ligny, and the Prussians, after
a desperate conflict, were compelled to retreat to Wavre.
This caused the Duke of Wellington to make a corresponding
movement, to keep up his communication with
them.</p>

<p>In the course of the morning of the 17th of June, the
troops were withdrawn from <em>Quatre Bras</em>, and proceeded
towards <em>Waterloo</em>. On this day, the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
had Lieutenant Joseph William Henry Streaphan and
three rank and file killed.</p>

<p>The position which the Duke of Wellington occupied
in front of <em>Waterloo</em>, crossed the high roads leading from
Charleroi and Nivelle to Brussels, and which roads
united at the village of Mont St. Jean, in the rear of
the British. The right wing extended to a ravine near
Merke Braine, which was occupied. The left extended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
to a height above the hamlet of Ter la Haye, which
was likewise occupied. In front of the right centre, and
near the Nivelle road, the house and garden of Hougomont
were taken possession of, and in front of the left
centre, the farm of La Haye Sainte was occupied. By
the left the British communicated with Marshal Prince
Blucher at Wavre, through Ohaim.</p>

<p>Napoleon collected his army on a range of heights
in front of the British, with the exception of his third
corps, which he had sent to observe the Prussians.
About ten o’clock the French commenced a furious
attack upon the post at Hougomont. Then ensued a
conflict which will ever be memorable in the history of
Europe. The attacks of the French troops were frequently
calculated to spread confusion through any
army. They were supported by the thunder of a numerous
artillery, and followed up by such a succession
of column after column, rolling onwards like the waves
of the sea, that it required a degree of unexampled fortitude
and courage to oppose effectual resistance to so
fierce and continued a storm of war.</p>

<p>That degree of courage was not wanting in the
British ranks, and paralysed by the fierce determination
of his opponents, the attacks of Napoleon’s legions
relaxed; the Prussians arrived on the left to co-operate;
the Anglo-Belgian army formed line, and with one
impetuous charge decided the fortune of the day. The
French were driven from the field with the loss of their
cannon and equipage, and the hopes of Bonaparte were
annihilated.</p>

<p>During the greater part of the battle, the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>,
with the second battalion of the thirtieth, were
very much exposed to the enemy’s artillery, and constantly
engaged in repelling numerous charges of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
cavalry that appeared determined to break their square,
which ultimately was reduced to a very small size, from
the casualties occasioned by round and grape shot.
Lieutenant Robert Stewart, one of the junior officers
of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, commanded the battalion at the
termination of the battle, and in consequence was some
years afterwards promoted to a company without
purchase.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The casualties amongst the officers were unusually
great. Of <em>twenty-three</em> who marched into action on the
16th of June at Quatre Bras, <em>twenty-two</em> were killed
and wounded on that and the two following days.</p>

<p>In the battle on the 18th of June the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
had Captains Alexander Robertson and John Kennedy;
Lieutenant Matthew Hollis; and Ensigns William
Law Lowe and Charles Page <em>killed</em>.</p>

<p>The officers wounded were Lieut.-Colonel William
George Harris (Colonel) commanding the battalion,
severely; Major Archibald John Maclean, who died
of his wounds; Captains Henry Coane, William
Wharton, and John Garland, all severely. Lieutenants
John McConnell, Thomas Reynolds, and
Donald Browne all severely; Lieutenant Browne afterwards
died of his wounds. Ensigns William McBean,
Charles Bedford Eastwood, and George Dondridge
Bridge (severely), and Ensign and Adjutant Patrick
Hay severely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>Three serjeants, one drummer, and forty-three rank
and file were killed, and thirteen serjeants, two
drummers, and one hundred and sixty rank and file
were wounded; twenty-four of the above number died
of their wounds; forty-one rank and file were missing.</p>

<p>In acknowledgment of the services which the army
performed in the battle of Waterloo, and the actions
immediately preceding it, each subaltern officer and
soldier present were permitted to count two years
additional service, and silver medals were conferred on
all ranks, bearing on the one side an impression of
His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, and on the
reverse the figure of Victory, holding the palm in the
right hand, and the olive branch in the left, with the
word “<em>Wellington</em>” over its head, and “<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>,”
18th June, 1815, at its feet.</p>

<p>The thanks of both Houses of Parliament were voted
to the army with the greatest enthusiasm, “for its distinguished
valour at Waterloo;” and the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
and other regiments engaged, were permitted to bear
the word “<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>” on their colours and appointments,
in commemoration of their distinguished services
on the 18th of June, 1815.</p>

<p>After the battle of Waterloo, the battalion, which
was reduced to a complete skeleton, advanced with the
army to Paris, where it arrived in the first week in
July, and encamped in the Bois de Boulogne until
November, when it was placed in cantonments in the
vicinity of that metropolis.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Louis XVIII. had entered Paris, and was
again reinstated on the throne of his ancestors. Napoleon
Bonaparte had surrendered himself to Captain
Maitland, commanding the “Bellerophon” British ship
of war, and the island of St. Helena having been fixed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
for his residence, he was conveyed thither, with a few
of his zealous adherents.</p>

<p>When the allied forces retired from Paris in December,
1815, with the exception of the “<em>Army of Occupation</em>”
left in France, the second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
regiment was ordered to return to England; it
embarked at Calais on the 23rd of December, and
landed on the same day at Ramsgate; from Ramsgate
it marched to Colchester to join the depôt, which continued
in that town during the absence of the battalion
on foreign service.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1816</div>

<p>The battalion afterwards marched to Nottingham,
where it arrived on the 12th of February, 1816.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>The battalion was stationed between Nottingham,
Weedon, and Colchester, until May, 1817, when it was
ordered to proceed to Chelmsford to be disbanded,
which measure took place on the 4th of May, 1817,
the most effective men, consisting of three hundred and
ten non-commissioned officers and privates being embarked
to join the first battalion of the regiment at
Ceylon.</p>

<p class="pfs100 smcap">Conclusion.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="noindent">The earlier services of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment,
originally formed as a second battalion to the forty-second
Highlanders, are connected with the wars against
Hyder Ali and his son, Tippoo Saib, the powerful
sultans of the Mysore territory: the word “<em>Mangalore</em>,”
granted by royal authority for the gallant defence of
that fortress in 1783, and the word “<em>Seringapatam</em>” for
the share taken by the regiment in the capture of the
capital of Tippoo’s country in 1799, when that sovereign
terminated his career by a soldier’s death, are borne
on the regimental colour and appointments, in commemoration
of these arduous campaigns in India.</p>

<p>Other services were, however, performed by the
regiment in the East, among which may be named the
capture of the French settlement of <em>Pondicherry</em> in
1793, and that of the Dutch island of <em>Ceylon</em> in 1796,
when the French Directory had caused Holland to
become involved in hostilities with Great Britain.</p>

<p>After a service of <em>twenty-four</em> years in India, the
regiment returned to England, and arrived at Greenwich
in July, 1806.</p>

<p>In 1809 the regiment proceeded to New South Wales,
when a second battalion was added to its establishment.</p>

<p>Brief as was the career of the second battalion,
namely from 1809 to 1817, it added the imperishable
word “<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>” to the regimental colour and appointments,
that distinction being conferred by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Sovereign to commemorate its services in that battle,
which gave a lengthened peace to the powers of Europe.</p>

<p>In 1814 the first battalion embarked from New South
Wales for Ceylon, in the capture of which island the
regiment had formerly participated.</p>

<p>The regiment returned to England in 1821, and
continued on home service until 1827, when it embarked
for Gibraltar, from which fortress it proceeded
to Malta in 1829, and in 1834 to the Ionian Islands,
whence it returned to Gibraltar in 1838, and embarked
for North America.</p>

<p>In 1841 the regiment returned to England, and, in
1845, proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope, where it is
now employed in active operations against the Kaffirs.</p>

<p>The orderly behaviour of the regiment in quarters,
whether employed at home, or on foreign stations, combined
with its soldier-like conduct in the field, have
secured the confidence of the nation, and the approbation
of the Sovereign.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> On the 21st of August, 1810, the French Marshal Bernadotte,
one of Napoleon’s generals, was elected Crown Prince of Sweden.
The appointment of a successor to the throne of that country was considered
necessary in consequence of the Duke of Sudermania, who had
been elected king in the room of the deposed Gustavus IV., being
advanced in years, and without children.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> The following statement of the above operations is contained in
the <cite>Annual Register</cite>, vol. 87, page 280:&mdash;</p>

<p>“After landing at Stralsund, and assisting in completing the works
of that town, Lieut.-Colonel Harris, with the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, was
detached into the interior of the country, to feel for the enemy,
and also to get into communication with Lieut.-General Count
Wallmoden, which dangerous service he successfully effected,
though he had, with great care and caution, to creep with his small
force between the large <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps d’armée</i> of Davoust and other French
generals at that time stationed in Pomerania, Mecklenburg, and
Hanover. Having joined Count Wallmoden, the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
contributed greatly to the victory that General gained over the
French on the plains of Gorde, in Hanover, where Lieut.-Colonel
Harris, at the head of his battalion, declining any aid, and at the
moment when the German hussars had been routed, charged up a
steep hill, took a battery of French artillery, and unfurling the
British colours, at once spread terror amongst that gallant enemy
which feared no others; a panic struck them, and they fled.”</p>

I must’; it is almost needless to add that immediately he was led
back to his proper place, and the ranks closed up by men still more
devoted than before.”&mdash;(<cite>Annual Register</cite>, <em>vol. 87</em>, page 280.)</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Sir George Osborn, Bart.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 18th April, 1786</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The early services of this officer were associated with the
sixteenth light dragoons, in which, upon that regiment being
raised in 1759, Sir George Osborn, Bart., obtained a troop
on the 20th of December of that year, and on the 13th of
February, 1762, he was promoted to the rank of major in
the eighteenth, Royal Irish, regiment of foot. On the 31st of
March, 1763, Major Sir George Osborn was appointed
deputy quarter-master-general to the Forces in Ireland, and
on the 19th of November, 1765, he was promoted to the
third regiment of foot guards as captain and lieut.-colonel, in
which regiment he was appointed second major, with the
brevet rank of colonel in the army, on the 7th of August,
1777. On the 19th of February, 1779, he was advanced to
the rank of major-general, and was appointed lieut.-colonel in
the third regiment of foot guards on the 25th of March, 1782.
Upon the second battalion of the forty-second, Royal Highlanders,
being numbered the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> Highland
regiment in 1786, His Majesty King George III. appointed
Major-General Sir George Osborn, Bart., to the colonelcy of
the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> on the 18th of April of that year, and on
the 11th of August following he was removed to the fortieth
regiment, which he retained until his decease. On the 28th
of September 1787, Sir George Osborn was advanced to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
rank of lieut.-general, and to that of general on the 26th of
January, 1797. General Sir George Osborn died at Chicksands
Priory on the 29th of June, 1818, in the seventy-seventh
year of his age.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">Sir William Medows, K.B.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 11th August, 1786</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The early services of this distinguished officer are connected
with the fourth horse, now seventh dragoon guards, in
which corps he was appointed captain in March, 1764, and
was promoted to the rank of major on the 1st of October, 1766.
He was further advanced to the rank of lieut.-colonel of the
fifth Fusiliers in 1769; was removed to the twelfth light
dragoons in 1773, and to the fifty-fifth regiment in 1775.
While serving with his regiment in North America, he evinced
that valour, magnanimity, and military skill, which were afterwards
more fully developed in the West, and also the East
Indies. He was again removed to the lieut.-colonelcy of the
fifth Fusiliers in 1777, in succession to Lieut.-Colonel Walcott,
who died of wounds received at the battle of Germantown, in
Pennsylvania, which was fought on the 4th of October, 1777.
He commanded the fifth during the long and hazardous retreat
from Philadelphia to New York; and having been appointed
to act as brigadier-general, he proceeded with the expedition
under Major-General James Grant to the West Indies.
Brigadier-General Medows commanded the reserve, consisting
of the fifth foot, grenadiers, and light infantry, at the attack
of St. Lucia in December 1778; and having seized on the
post of La Vigie, he evinced signal intrepidity in defending it
against the attacks of a French force of very superior numbers:
though severely wounded early in the day, he refused to
quit his post, and finding his ammunition nearly expended, he
drew up his men in front of their colours, and waving his
sword, exclaimed, “Soldiers, as long as you have a bayonet to
point against an enemy’s breast, defend these colours.”
They did so, and secured the conquest of St. Lucia.</p>

<p>His distinguished bravery was rewarded in 1780, with the
colonelcy of the (late) eighty-ninth regiment: and in 1781 he was
promoted to the local rank of major-general in the East Indies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
where he acquired numerous laurels under General the Earl
Cornwallis. He was promoted to the rank of major-general
in 1782, and was appointed to the colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
Highland regiment on the 11th of August, 1786; and
his meritorious services procured him the honor of wearing
the insignia of a Knight Companion of the Bath. Sir William
Medows was afterwards <ins class="corr" id="tn-59" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'appointed Govenor'">
appointed Governor</ins> and Commander-in-Chief
of Madras. In 1792 Sir William Medows was
promoted to the rank of lieut.-general; in 1796 he was
appointed colonel of the seventh dragoon guards; and in 1798
was advanced to the rank of general. He was also Governor
of Hull, and a member of the Privy Council in Ireland. The
decease of General Sir William Medows, K.B., occurred on
the 20th of November, 1813.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">Gerard Lake,</p>

<p class="center">(Afterwards Viscount Lake.)</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 2nd November, 1796</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Gerard Lake, third son of Lancelot Charles Lake, Esq.,
choosing the profession of arms, was nominated to the commission
of ensign and lieutenant in the first foot guards, on the
9th of May, 1758; in 1762 he was promoted to lieutenant and
captain, and in 1776 to captain and lieut.-colonel. He served
in North America during the War of Independence; was
engaged in operations in the southern states, under
General the Earl Cornwallis, and had opportunities of distinguishing
himself. When Earl Cornwallis’s force was
besieged in York Town, by the united French and American
armies, Lieut.-Colonel Lake commanded a detachment of foot
guards and grenadiers of the eightieth regiment, which made
a sortie on the 16th of October, 1781, forced the entrenchments,
spiked eleven heavy guns, and killed and wounded about a
hundred French soldiers. On the surrender of York Town
he became a prisoner of war; but hostilities were terminated
soon afterwards, and he returned to England, having been
promoted to the rank of colonel in February, 1782. In 1784
he was nominated major, and in 1792 lieut.-colonel in the
first foot guards. In 1790 he was advanced to the rank of
major-general. On the breaking out of the French revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
war, he was nominated to the command of the brigade
of foot guards which proceeded to Flanders, and served under
His Royal Highness the Duke of York. He commanded this
brigade at the battle of Famars, and at the siege of Valenciennes,
and highly distinguished himself at Lincelles, on
the 18th of August, 1793, for which he was thanked in general
orders. He also served before Dunkirk, and in other operations:
and in 1794 he was rewarded with the colonelcy of
the fifty-third regiment, and the government of Limerick;
he was afterwards nominated Governor of Dumbarton. In
1796 he was removed to the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment: in
1797 he was promoted to the rank of lieut.-general, and placed
on the staff of Ireland, where he evinced talent and energy in
suppressing the rebellion which broke out in 1798, and gained
several important victories over the insurgents. When
the French landed in Ireland, he was obliged to retire a short
distance; but additional troops advancing to his aid, he intercepted
the French soldiers and forced them to surrender
prisoners of war. In 1800 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief
in India, and colonel of the eightieth regiment; and in
1802 he was promoted to the rank of general. He arrived in
India at the period when the Governor-General, the Marquis
Wellesley, was displaying the energies of his mind in counteracting
the intrigues of France among the native powers of
Hindoostan; and the ambitious designs of the Mahratta chiefs
soon called General Lake into the field, when his talents
were conspicuously displayed. His spirited and judicious
operations at Coel, on the 29th of August, 1803; the assault
of Aly Ghur, on the 9th of September; and the overthrow of
the Mahratta army near Delhi, on the 11th of September, on
which occasion his charger was killed under him, produced
decisive results. The country between the Ganges and Jumna
rivers, called the Doab (a general name in India for the
space between two rivers), became subject to British authority;
and six days afterwards General Lake visited the Emperor, Shah
Alum, whom he had rescued from oppression, and who conferred
upon him titles which signified,&mdash;The Saver of the State,&mdash;Hero
of the Land,&mdash;Lord of the Age,&mdash;and the Victorious
in War.</p>

<p>Afterwards proceeding to Agra, General Lake speedily
captured that place, and on the 1st of November, 1803, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
gained an important victory at Leswaree, when the French-officered
battalions of Dowlat Rao Scindia were annihilated,
the Mahratta army overpowered, and its colours, artillery, and
baggage captured. His services on this occasion were of a
distinguished character; he led the charge of the cavalry in
the morning;&mdash;conducted in person the attacks of the infantry,
and in the midst of the storm of battle he displayed valour,
professional ability, promptitude and decision; his magnanimous
example inspired confidence and emulation in the troops,
and they triumphed over very superior numbers. Two
horses were killed under him on this occasion.</p>

<p>His important services were rewarded, in 1804, with the
title of <span class="smcap">Lord Lake of Delhi and Leswaree</span>.</p>

<p>Pursuing, the war with vigour, Lord Lake routed the
power of Holkar at Furruckbad; but the war was protracted
by the defection of the Rajah of Bhurtpore; and when his
Lordship besieged the city of Bhurtpore, he failed in capturing
the place from the want of a battering train. The Rajah of
Bhurtpore was, however, brought to terms; and Lord Lake
pursued the hostile Rajah of Berar from place to place until
this chief was brought to submission. The British military
power in the East was strengthened by these successes; and
the extent and stability of the dominions in India augmented.</p>

<p>His Lordship returned to England, and in 1807 he was
advanced to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Viscount Lake</span>.</p>

<p>He caught cold while sitting on the general court-martial
which tried Major-General Whitelocke; and died on the 30th
of February, 1808.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">George Lord Harris, G.C.B.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 14th February, 1800.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">This distinguished officer entered the service in 1759 as a
cadet in the Royal Artillery, and was appointed ensign in
the fifth fusiliers on the 30th of July, 1762; he was promoted
to be lieutenant on the 2nd of July, 1765, was appointed
adjutant in 1767, and promoted to the rank of
captain on the 25th of July, 1771. In May, 1774, Captain
Harris embarked for America, and was present in the first
action of the American war, namely, at Lexington, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
19th of April, 1775. At the battle of Bunker’s Hill on the
17th of June following, he was severely wounded in the head,
and obliged to be trepanned, which caused him to be sent to
England; but he returned in time to take the field previously
to the landing of the British army on Long Island in August,
1776. Captain Harris was present at the affair of Flat Bush;
in the skirmishes on York Island; in the engagement at
White Plains; at Iron Hill (where he was shot through the
leg), and in every action up to the 3rd of November, 1778,
except that of Germantown. In 1778 he was promoted to
the rank of major in the fifth fusiliers, and embarked with
the regiment for the West Indies with the force under Major-General
James Grant, by whom he was appointed to command
the battalion of grenadiers, and landed with the reserve of the
army under Brigadier-General Medows, at St. Lucia on the
25th of December. After the taking of Morne Fortunée,
Major Harris was second in command under Brigadier-General
Medows at the post of La Vigie, where the French were
repulsed in their repeated attacks, and in consequence they
retreated from the Island. Immediately after the departure
of the French armament, the Governor surrendered the
Island of St. Lucia to the British troops, the capitulation
being signed on the 30th of December, 1778. In 1779,
Major Harris embarked with the fifth fusiliers, which were
ordered to serve as marines, and was present in the engagement
off Grenada, under Admiral Byron, on the 6th of July, 1779.
In 1780, Major Harris returned to England, and in December
of that year succeeded to a lieut.-colonelcy in the fifth
fusiliers, from which he exchanged into the seventy-sixth
regiment, and accompanied to the East Indies, as secretary,
Sir William Medows, who was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief
of Madras. Lieut.-Colonel Harris served in
the campaigns of 1790 and 1791 against Tippoo Sultan; in
the action of the 15th of May, 1791, he was appointed by
General the Earl Cornwallis to command the second line;
he was also personally engaged in the attack of the Sultan’s
camp and of the Island of Seringapatam, on the night of the
6th of February, 1792, the success of which terminated that
war. Peace being re-established, Lieut.-Colonel Harris
returned with Lieut.-General Sir William Medows to England.
On the 18th of November, 1792, he was promoted colonel by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
brevet, and on the 3rd of October, 1794, he was advanced to
the rank of major-general, when he re-embarked for India,
and was placed on the Bengal Staff. On the 3rd of May,
1796, Major-General Harris received the local rank of lieut.-general,
and was appointed Commander-in-Chief in the Presidency
of Fort St. George; in February, 1798, he succeeded
to the military and civil government of the troops and territories
of Madras.</p>

<p>In December, 1798, Lieut.-General Harris was selected, by
the Marquis Wellesley to command the army assembled to
repel the threatened hostility of Tippoo Sultan, to besiege his
capital, and to reduce his power. The army under the command
of Lieut.-General Harris exceeded fifty thousand men,
and the object of the expedition was accomplished by the
capture of <em>Seringapatam</em>, the death of Tippoo, and annexation
of his dominions to the British Crown, as detailed in the
Historical Record of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, of which regiment
he was appointed colonel on the 14th of February, 1800, as a
reward for his important services:&mdash;on the 1st of January,
1801, he was promoted to the rank of lieut.-general. On
the 1st of January, 1812, Lieut.-General Harris was advanced
to the rank of general. In August, 1815, General Harris
was raised to the peerage by the title of Baron Harris of
Seringapatam and Mysore in the East Indies, and of Belmont
in Kent, and was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the
Order of the Bath on the 27th of May, 1820. His Lordship
succeeded General Francis Dundas as Governor of Dumbarton
Castle in January, 1824. During the latter years of his life
his Lordship lived in retirement at his seat at Belmont,
Feversham, in Kent, where his decease occurred on the 19th
of May, 1829, at the advanced age of eighty-two years.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">The Right Honorable Sir Frederick Adam,

<p class="p2 center smcap">William George Lord Harris, C.B., &amp; K.C.H.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 4th December, 1835.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">This distinguished officer was the son of General the first
Lord Harris, and entered the army as an ensign in the seventy-sixth
regiment of infantry, on the 24th of May, 1795; was
promoted lieutenant in the thirty-sixth regiment on the 3rd
of January, 1796, from which he was removed to the seventy-fourth
Highlanders on the 4th of September following, and
joined in India in 1797. Lieutenant Harris served at the
battle of Mallavelly on the 27th of March, 1799, and during
the campaign under his father, Lord Harris, which led to the
capture of Seringapatam, and was in nearly all the affairs,
out-posts, and in the storming party on the 4th of May, 1799,
which carried that fortress, where Lieutenant Harris was one
of the first to enter the breach, for which he was commended
on the spot by Major-General (afterwards Sir David) Baird.
Being sent home with the captured standards, Lieutenant
Harris had the honor of presenting them to His Majesty
King George III., and was promoted to a company in the
forty-ninth regiment, on the 16th of October, 1800, which he
joined at Jersey, and embarking with it towards the end of
the year for England, was wrecked on the passage off Guernsey.
Captain Harris afterwards accompanied his regiment in
the expedition to the Baltic under the command of Admiral
Parker and Vice-Admiral Nelson, and was present in the
“Glatton” frigate in the desperate action off Copenhagen on the
2nd of April, 1801. In 1802, Captain Harris embarked with
the forty-ninth regiment for Canada, and served in the upper
province for two years; being then appointed to a majority in
the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment, he proceeded to join that corps
in India, and on his way out was employed at the capture of
the Cape of Good Hope in January, 1806, and was present
at the action of Blue Berg. The <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> having
quitted India previously to his arrival, he returned to England
the same year, and found he had succeeded to the lieut.-colonelcy
of that regiment. Upon the formation of the
second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>, which was placed on
the establishment of the army from the 24th of December,
1808, Lieut.-Colonel Harris was appointed to the command
of it, and zealously applied himself to perfecting its discipline,
and rendering it efficient in every respect. In 1813, Lieut.-Colonel
Harris embarked on a particular service with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment, but afterwards
joined the expedition to Stralsund, in Swedish Pomerania,
under Major-General Samuel Gibbs. On arrival
Lieut.-Colonel Harris was selected to take the field with his
battalion, and place himself under the orders of Lieut.-General
Count Wallmoden, and was present in the action of the
Gorde (in which he highly distinguished himself), under that
commander, on the 16th of September, 1813. In November,
1813, the second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> re-embarked
in the Gulf of Lubec for England; but on arriving at Yarmouth,
it was ordered, without landing, to join the army of
General Sir Thomas Graham (afterwards Lord Lynedoch) in
Holland. During the winter campaign before Antwerp, rendered
more difficult in consequence of the severity of the
weather, Lieut.-Colonel Harris had the honor of carrying the
village of Merxem by storm, under the eye of His late
Majesty King William IV., then Duke of Clarence, and,
during the remainder of the operations, was employed as
brigadier-general. After the peace of 1814, when Antwerp
was delivered up, Colonel Harris, to which rank he had been
promoted on the 4th of June, 1814, was quartered in that
town, and remained in the Low Countries with his battalion
during the remainder of the year 1814, and the early part of
1815. On the return of Napoleon from Elba, Colonel Harris
joined the army of the Duke of Wellington, and his battalion
was appointed to the brigade commanded by Major-General
Sir Colin Halkett, and took part in the stubborn contest of
the 16th of June, 1815, at <em>Quatre Bras</em>,&mdash;assisted in covering
the retreat on the 17th; and on the 18th of June, at <em>Waterloo</em>,
bore a gallant part in the complete defeat of Napoleon in
that memorable battle. Colonel Harris, late in the afternoon,
received a shot through the right shoulder, from which severe
wound he continued to suffer at times for the remainder of
his life. On retiring on half-pay, a testimony of admiration
and regard was presented to him by the officers of his battalion
in the shape of a splendid sword. On the 19th of
July, 1821, Colonel Harris was advanced to the rank of Major-General.
Major-General the Honorable William George
Harris was employed on the staff of the army in Ireland from
the 17th of May, 1823, until the 24th of June, 1825, when
he was appointed to the command of the northern district of
Great Britain, which he retained until the 24th of July, 1828,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
and contributed materially in quelling the disturbances in the
manufacturing districts. On the decease of his father, Lord
Harris, in 1829, he succeeded to the title, and from that
period lived in retirement at Belmont, the family seat, near
Feversham in Kent. On the 3rd of December, 1832, Major-General
Lord Harris was appointed colonel of the eighty-sixth
regiment, and was removed to the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> on
the 4th of December, 1835. In January, 1837, Lord Harris
was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-General. His decease
occurred at Belmont, after a short illness, on the 30th of May,
1845. Lord Harris was a Knight Commander of the Royal
Hanoverian Guelphic Order, a Companion of the Bath, and a
Knight of the Order of William of Holland.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap">Sir Robert Henry Dick, K.C.B., &amp; K.C.H.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 10th June, 1845.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">This officer commenced his military career as ensign in the
seventy-fifth regiment, his commission being dated 22nd of
November, 1800, from which he was promoted to the rank of
lieutenant in the sixty-second foot, on the 27th of June, 1802;
was appointed to the ninth battalion of reserve on the 20th of
December, 1803, and removed to the forty-second Royal Highland
regiment on the 5th of January of the following year.
Lieutenant Dick was promoted to the rank of Captain in the
seventy-eighth regiment on the 17th of April, 1804, and embarked
with the second battalion of that corps for Sicily in
1806; in the battle of Maida, which was fought on the 4th
of July, 1806, Captain Dick was wounded; was also present
at the taking of the fortress of Catrone in Calabria. Admiral
Sir John Duckworth having failed in his mission to detach
Turkey from the interests of France, Great Britain determined
to seize upon Egypt, as a check to any fresh demonstration
by the French against the British possessions in the
East Indies, and an armament sailed from Sicily in February,
1807, and landed at Aboukir on the 18th of the following
month. This expedition was under the command of Major-General
Alexander Mackenzie Fraser, the colonel of the
seventy-eighth Highlanders, and Captain Dick was embarked
with the second battalion of that regiment. On the 21st of
March, 1807, Alexandria was occupied by the British troops;
this was the anniversary of the celebrated battle fought there
in 1801, when the gallant General Sir Ralph Abercromby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
received the wound which terminated his career. A force of
fifteen hundred men was afterwards detached against Rosetta,
before which place Captain Dick was severely wounded.
Egypt was evacuated by the British in September, 1807, and
the troops returned to Sicily. Captain Dick was promoted
to the rank of Major on the 24th of April, 1808, and was
appointed to the forty-second Royal Highlanders on the 14th of
July following. Major Dick embarked with the second
battalion of the forty-second regiment for the Peninsula in
June, 1809, and commanded a light battalion at the battle of
Busaco on the 27th of September, 1810, and during the retreat
to the lines of Torres Vedras; also in the action at Foz
D’Aronce on the 15th of March, 1811, where he was wounded;
and at the battle of Fuentes d’Onor on the 3rd and 5th of
May following. During the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, which
was captured on the 19th of January, 1812, Major Dick
served with the second battalion of the forty-second regiment,
and also at the third siege of Badajoz, which was taken on the
6th of April following. On the first battalion of the forty-second
joining the army in the Peninsula towards the end of
April, 1812, the soldiers of the second battalion fit for duty
were transferred to the former, and the officers and staff of
the latter returned to England to recruit. He commanded a
light battalion at the battle of Salamanca on the 22nd of July,
1812. At the storming of Fort St. Michael, near Burgos, on
the 19th of September, Major Dick commanded the first battalion
of the forty-second, and his conduct was commended in
the Marquis of Wellington’s public despatch. The siege of
the Castle of Burgos was afterwards commenced, but the concentration
of the enemy’s forces obliged the British commander
to raise the siege and retire to Salamanca, and subsequently
to Ciudad Rodrigo. On the 8th of October, 1812, Major
Dick was promoted to the brevet rank of Lieut.-Colonel. In
January 1813, Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Dick returned to England
on two months’ leave of absence, and joined the
second battalion, which, after its return from the Peninsula
in 1812, had remained in North Britain, until it was disbanded
after the termination of the war in 1814.</p>

<p>During the campaign of 1815, Lieut.-Colonel Dick served
with the forty-second regiment, and after the death of Lieut.-Colonel
Sir Robert Macara, K.C.B., at Quatre Bras on the
16th of June of that year, the command of the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
devolved on Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Dick, who was slightly
wounded in the hip and severely in the left shoulder. He
was promoted to be lieut.-colonel of the forty-second regiment
on the 18th of June, 1815, the date of the battle of
Waterloo, for which he received a medal, in addition to the
medal and two clasps conferred on him for the battles of
Busaco, Fuentes d’Onor, and Salamanca, and was appointed a
Companion of the Order of the Bath.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Dick was promoted to the rank of colonel
on the 27th of May, 1825, on being appointed aide-de-camp
to King George IV., and in November, 1828, exchanged from
the forty-second regiment to the half-pay unattached. On
the 10th of January, 1837, Colonel Dick was promoted to the
rank of major-general, and on the 19th of July, 1838, was
nominated a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.
From December 1838 to July 1842, Major-General Sir
Robert Dick served upon the staff of the army at Madras, and
was afterwards removed to the Presidency of Bengal. Major-General
Sir Robert Dick was appointed by Her Majesty to be
colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment on the 10th of June,
1845.</p>

<p>Upon the invasion of the British territories in India by the
Sikhs in the beginning of December 1845, Major-General
Sir Robert Dick was appointed to the command of the third
infantry division of the “<em>Army of the Sutlej</em>,” and after
sharing in the battle of Moodkee on the 18th of December,
and that of Ferozeshah on the 21st and 22nd of the same
month, was wounded by a grape-shot at Sobraon on the 10th
of February, 1846, while personally animating the troops
under his command, from the effects of which he died in the
evening of that day. This victory brought the operations in
the field to a close, and the Sikh city of Lahore was occupied
by the British troops, where a treaty was concluded which
was considered calculated to prevent the repetition of a similar
outrage.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Memoir of the Services of Major-General Lachlan Macquarie,
formerly Lieut.-Colonel of the</em> <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> <em>regiment</em>.</p>

<p class="p1 noindent">Major-General Lachlan Macquarie entered the army
on the 9th of April, 1777, as ensign in the late eighty-fourth
regiment, (which was disbanded in 1784), and performed garrison
duty at Halifax, and other parts of Nova Scotia, for four
years, namely, from the year 1777 to 1781. On the 18th of
January, 1781, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in
the late seventy-first regiment, and did garrison duty at New
York and Charleston, in North America, and in the island of
Jamaica for three years. He was placed on half-pay on the
4th of June, 1784, and was appointed lieutenant in the seventy-seventh
regiment on the 25th of December, 1787, and promoted
to the rank of captain on the 9th of November, 1788.
Captain Macquarie served in various parts of India, from
the 3rd of August, 1788, to the 1st of January, 1803; was
present at the sieges of Cannanore, in 1790, at Seringapatam
in 1791, at Cochin in 1795, and at Colombo, in Ceylon, in
1796. As a reward for his services he had received the brevet
rank of major on the 3rd of May, 1796, and continued
to serve in various parts of India, during the above-mentioned
periods. Brevet Major Macquarie was present at
the battle of Seedaseer on the 6th of March, 1799, and at
the siege of Seringapatam in April and May following. Brevet
Major Macquarie was afterwards employed on service
in Malabar, and on the 12th of March, 1801, was promoted
from the seventy-seventh to the eighty-sixth regiment. Major
Macquarie proceeded with the eighty-sixth and other regiments
ordered to embark from India, under Major-General David
Baird, to join the army in Egypt, and was present at
the siege of Alexandria in August, 1801. In November following
he was promoted to the brevet rank of lieut.-colonel.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
He served at home as Assistant Adjutant-General on the
London District Staff, from July, 1803, until March, 1805;
and afterwards in India, with the eighty-sixth regiment
in the field in 1805 and 1806. On the 30th of May, 1805,
he was appointed lieut.-colonel in the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment,
which corps he returned home to join in 1807, and in May,
1809, embarked with his regiment for New South Wales, of
which colony, and its dependencies, he was appointed Governor
and Commander-in-Chief. On the 25th July, 1810, he was
advanced to the brevet rank of colonel, was appointed brigadier-general
on the 21st of February, 1811, and promoted
major-general on the 4th of June, 1813. His decease occurred
in July, 1824.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Memoir of the Services of Lieut.-General Sir Maurice Charles
O’Connell, K.C.H., formerly Lieut.-Colonel of the</em>
<span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> <em>regiment</em>.</p>

<p class="p1 noindent">This officer, after serving with the rank of captain in the
emigrant army under the Duke of Brunswick in the campaign
of 1792, entered the British army sent to the Continent on the
breaking out of the war in 1793. He was appointed captain in
the fourth regiment of the late Irish brigade on the 1st of
October, 1794, and was placed on half-pay on the 1st of
March, 1798, on the reduction of that regiment; he was appointed
captain in the first West India regiment on the 21st
of May, 1800, and joined shortly afterwards at St. Lucia;
Captain O’Connell was appointed major of brigade to the
forces at Surinam in February, 1802, and served in that colony
until its restoration to the Dutch in December of that
year, when he joined his regiment at St. Vincent. In May,
1803, he proceeded in command of five companies to Grenada,
whence he was ordered with the whole of the regiment to
Dominica in 1804. On the 1st of January, 1805, he received
the brevet rank of major. He commanded the light company
at Roseau, in Dominica, when an attack was made on that
capital on the 22nd of February, 1805, by a French force
commanded by General La Grange, and successfully resisted,
during the whole day, repeated attacks made by very superior
numbers of the enemy on the posts occupied by Brevet Major<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
O’Connell, with the forty-sixth regiment, his own company of
the first West India regiment, and some colonial militia. He
had been appointed major of brigade to the forces at Dominica
in February, 1805, and on the 23rd of May following, was
appointed major of the fifth West India regiment. In September
he returned to England. For his services in the defence
of Dominica, Major O’Connell received the thanks of
the House of Assembly in that island, and was presented by
that body with a sword, value one hundred guineas; he also
received a sword, value fifty pounds, and a piece of plate, value
one hundred pounds, from the committee of the Patriotic Fund
at Lloyd’s. On the 15th of October, 1806, Major O’Connell
was appointed to the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span> regiment, in which he
was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel on the 4th of May,
1809, and was appointed Lieut.-Governor of New South Wales,
where he continued until April, 1814, in which month he embarked
in command of the first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">SEVENTY-THIRD</span>
regiment for Ceylon. In January, 1815, Lieut.-Colonel
O’Connell marched in command of a division of the army
under Lieut.-General Robert Brownrigg into the territories of
the King of Candy, the conquest of which was achieved in forty
days, and crowned by the capture of the reigning monarch,
who was deposed by his own subjects, and brought a prisoner
to Colombo. On the 12th of August, 1819, Lieut.-Colonel
O’Connell was promoted to the rank of colonel, and to that of
major-general on the 22nd of July, 1830. In 1838, Major-General
O’Connell was appointed to the command of the troops
in New South Wales, which appointment he held from December
of that year until December, 1847. On the 23rd of
November, 1841, Sir Maurice O’Connell was promoted to the
rank of lieut.-general, and was appointed colonel of the eighty-first
regiment on the 6th of December, 1842, from which he
was removed to the eightieth regiment on the 15th of January,
1844. The decease of Lieut.-General Sir Maurice Charles
O’Connell, K.C.H., occurred at Sydney, in New South Wales,
on the 25th of May, 1848.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
